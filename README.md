This is a repo where I store my excercises from MPIS (Metody Probabilistyczne i Statystyka) during my III semester of Algorithmic Computer Science on the University of Science and Technology in Wrocław 2024.

## Zad1 

Excersise No. 1: **Monte Carlo Method for Approximation**.  
*Objective*:  Approximate integrals of given functions using a probabilistic Monte Carlo method.  
*Tasks*:
  - Implement and test the algorithm for three integrals and estimate π.
  - Perform experiments for varying numbers of points and repetitions (e.g., 5,000 points and 50 repetitions).
  - Visualize results with scatter plots of calculated values, their means, and true values for comparison.
  - Ensure the use of high-quality random number generators like Mersenne Twister.

#### diff_approx
In this folder you'll find working <ins>C++</ins> code. Unfortunately you have to run it seperately for every funcion (all of them are implemented, and somewhat usefully commented). After running this code you should get <ins>.txt</ins> files that work within the python code in the next directory.  

#### monte_graph
In this folder you'll find working <ins>Python</ins> code. Unfortunately you have to run it seperately for every file (yes I didn't do it in a clever way, but it should be fairly easy to fix). After running this code you should get desired graphs.  

#### graphs
Folder contains graphs generated by me.  

## Zad2

Excercise No. 2: **Balls and Bins Model**  
*Objective*: Study classical probabilistic problems using simulations of throwing balls into bins.  
*Tasks*:
  - Measure outcomes like first collision, empty bins, and steps to fill all bins or double-fill all bins.
  - Conduct experiments with independent repetitions for various bin counts (e.g., up to 100,000 bins).
  - Analyze and visualize data using ratio-based metrics and hypothesize asymptotic behaviors.
  - Explore applications like hash functions and cryptographic hashing using the birthday paradox.

#### balls_and_bins
In this folder you'll find working <ins>C++</ins> code.  
It prints out data into four txt files, that you can feed into python program in <ins>ball_graph</ins>

#### ball_graph
In this folder you'll find working <ins>Python</ins> code. Unfortunately you have to run it seperately for every file (simmiliar to the last one, it'll be reoccuring theme here). After running this code you should get desired graphs.

## Zad3

Excercise No. 3: **Advanced Probabilistic Simulations and Analysis**  
*Objective 1 (balanced allocation)*: Examine how allowing each ball to choose the least-loaded urn from d uniformly random candidates affects the maximum load.  
*Tasks*:  
- Simulate the process for n balls and n urns for two scenarios:  
  - d = 1 — each ball chooses a single random urn.
  - d = 2 — each ball probes two random urns and is placed in the less-loaded one (ties broken arbitrarily).
- For both cases, record the maximum load​ over multiple independent repetitions and a range of n (e.g., 10 000 … 1 000 000).
- Plot the empirical mean​ and overlay the theoretical guide curves

*Objective 2 (Insertion Sort)*: Measure the cost of the classical INSERTIONSORT algorithm on random data.  
*Tasks*:  
- For every n∈{100,200,…,10000} generate k=50 uniformly random permutations and sort them.
- Record for each run:
  - the number of key comparisons cmp,
  - the number of key moves swaps.
- Plot
  - cmp(n) and the ratios cmp(n)/n and cmp(n)/n2,
  - swaps(n) and the ratios swaps(n)/n and swaps(n)/n2.

*Objective 3 (Noisy Broadcast in a Star Network)*: Investigate how quickly a single central station can disseminate a message to n leaf nodes when each transmission is received independently with probability p.  
*Tasks*:  
- Simulate rounds of broadcast on a star with n leaves for two reliability levels: p = 0.5 and p = 0.1.
- For each n and p, run multiple repetitions and record the completion time​ (first round in which every leaf has the message).
- Plot individual completion times and the empirical mean as a function of n.
