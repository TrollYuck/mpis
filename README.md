This is a repo where I store my excercises from MPIS (Metody Probabilistyczne i Statystyka) during my III semester of Algorithmic Computer Science on the University of Science and Technology in Wrocław 2024.

## Zad1 

Excersise No. 1: **Monte Carlo Method for Approximation**.  
*Objective*:  Approximate integrals of given functions using a probabilistic Monte Carlo method.  
*Tasks*:
  - Implement and test the algorithm for three integrals and estimate π.
  - Perform experiments for varying numbers of points and repetitions (e.g., 5,000 points and 50 repetitions).
  - Visualize results with scatter plots of calculated values, their means, and true values for comparison.
  - Ensure the use of high-quality random number generators like Mersenne Twister.

### diff_approx
In this folder you'll find working <ins>C++</ins> code. Unfortunately you have to run it seperately for every funcion (all of them are implemented, and somewhat usefully commented). After running this code you should get <ins>.txt</ins> files that work within the python code in the next directory.  

### monte_graph
In this folder you'll find working <ins>Python</ins> code. Unfortunately you have to run it seperately for every file (yes I didn't do it in a clever way, but it should be fairly easy to fix). After running this code you should get desired graphs.  

### graphs
Folder contains graphs generated by me.  

## Zad2

Excercise No. 2: **Balls and Bins Model**  
*Objective*: Study classical probabilistic problems using simulations of throwing balls into bins.  
*Tasks*:
  - Measure outcomes like first collision, empty bins, and steps to fill all bins or double-fill all bins.
  - Conduct experiments with independent repetitions for various bin counts (e.g., up to 100,000 bins).
  - Analyze and visualize data using ratio-based metrics and hypothesize asymptotic behaviors.
  - Explore applications like hash functions and cryptographic hashing using the birthday paradox.
